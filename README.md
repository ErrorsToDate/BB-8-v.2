# BB-8-v.2

version 2 of BB-8, since adding a bot framework  using the lib <a href="https://discord.js.org/#/"  target="_blank"><strong>Discord.JS</strong></a>
<br></br>
And using the Bot Framework, <a href="https://github.com/Gawdl3y/discord.js-commando"  target="_blank"><strong>Commando</strong></a>

Here's a quick list:
- Command framework (probably the most robust command system of any bot)
	* Plain names and aliases
	* Robust argument parsing (with "quoted strings" support)
	* Regular expression triggers
	* Multiple responses
	* Command editing
- Module system (allows you to disable modules and individual commands per server)
- Admin/moderator permissions (moderators are configurable)
- Channel restrictions (allow the bot to operate only in specific channels in a server)
- Storages to associate arbitrary data with a server
- Configurable command prefix (change the trigger for commands)
- Help system and detailed about command
- Eval command with a system for registering your own objects to make available in its scope, and some utilities
- Lots of utility methods to simplify your logic
- Update checking for your bot
- Stats sending to Carbon and bots.discord.pw
